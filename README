This is a provisional readme file for BioVisualization, a set of  browser 
independent Google Visuailzation API compliant biology oriented visualizations 
implemented in javascript and actionscript 3. Please feel free to 
edit and expand it. If something you need to do is not covered here contact 
us and we will update it.

Before starting you should read the google Visualization API documents 
to learn the basics of creating a data table and using API compliant 
visualizations:

1.  Getting set up in Flex Builder and building code.

	-creat your own fork on github if you wish to develop against the code
	(see: http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications)

	-check out from github using a command like: 
	git clone git@github.com:YOURUSERNAME/Lichen.git (if you have forked)
	git clone git://github.com/ryanbressler/Lichen (if you do not wish to fork)
	
	- open flex builder and go to file>New>ActionScript Project
	set the path to your Lichen dir and the name to Lichen
	and hit finish.
	
	- go to project>properties. Go to actionscript build path, and then go to the
	lib dir tab, click the add swc folder hit 'browse' button, and choose the 
	Lichen/lib sub dir.
	
	- Set bionetwork.as, bioheatmap.as or flexvistemplate.as as your default 
	executable (use theright click menu)
	
	- delete the contents of your html-template dir  and src/lichen.as 
	(to get rid of all auto generated stuff).
	
	- go to the Lichen dir in a shell and run: 
		git checkout html-template
	 to recreate the files in html-template from github.
	
	- Hit the build button and wait. A browser with bionetwork.html should come
	up, you can open any of the other html files at this point.
	
	- If you encounter a security zone error there are two possible fixes:
		1) Ensure there are no spaces in the path to the html file.
		
	 	2) Serve the Lichen/bin-debug directory with a web server then go to Project/Properties, 
	 	ActionScript Build Path, and set Output Folder URL to the URL where the bin-debug file 
	 	can be found (example: http://localhost/Lichen).
	
	- Make sure the swf is built in bin-debug. Then you 
	can go to bin-debug folder and open any html files under that folder.
	
	You may need to change the font family being embeded if your system does not have helvetica installed

2. BioNetwork Parameters
3. BioHeatmap Parmaters
	data:
		A google api datatable with numeric or string values, Column names and a row lable column in column 0.
		
		Strings will be parsed as numbers with the exception of special values Y and N
		
		If you provide row and column base urls (see below) the column id and column 0 value will be
		appended to them for links from the column and row lables.
		
	Options:
		noRowNames
		startColor
		endColor
		emptyDataColor
		numberOfColors
		passThroughBlack
		lockHeaders
		useRowLabels
		useCellLabels
		rowBaseUrl
		columnBaseUrl
		_cellBaseUrl
		cellWidth
		cellHeight
		mapWidth
		mapHeight
		fontHeight
		horizontalPadding
		cellBorder
		drawBorder
		
		TODO:
		_specialValueColors
		
4. Deploying on a server
	To deploy a visualization on a server you need to host the associated js and swf files. 
	Currentley, if you wish to host these files in a seperate directory you need to edit the path
	to the swf file in two places in the embed tag string. You can do this using find and replace 
	(EX bionetwork.swf -> /js/bionetwork.swf).
	
	We are looking for a more maintainable solution if anybody has any ideas.

5. Creating your own visualization using flexvistemplate

	The easiest way to start work on your own visualization is to create a copy of flexvistemplate.as,
	flexvistemplate.js and flexvistemplate.html. and use find and replace to update all occurences of
	flexvistemplate (should be mostly file names) and FlexVisTemplate (class names).
	
	After you have done this you can verify that everything is working using the debuger. Set your 
	new as file as the default executable, set a break point in the draw function after data import and 
	compile and run in debug mode.
